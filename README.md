Final Year Project: Emotion-Based Smart Attendance System

For my final year project, I developed an Emotion-Based Smart Attendance System aimed at enhancing attendance tracking through emotional analysis. Key components of the project included:

Real-Time Attendance Tracking: Utilized Python alongside advanced face detection algorithms such as Haar Cascade and OpenCV to accurately track attendance in real time.
Facial Emotion Analysis: Employed pre-trained deep learning models (CNN) to analyze facial expressions, enabling the system to assess students' emotional states during attendance.
Alert Mechanism: Implemented a notification system to promptly alert hostel wardens and parents based on students' emotional responses.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed intuitive interfaces to facilitate easy access to attendance records and notifications, ensuring a seamless user experience.
This project not only demonstrates my technical skills but also addresses the importance of emotional well-being in educational settings.
